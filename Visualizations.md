# Visualizing Data with Sustainability Tracker

Once youâ€™ve entered your data in the **Sustainability Tracker**, you can create visualizations (charts) to better understand trends and environmental impacts.

## Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. **Highlight Data**: Select the range of data you want to visualize (for example, Category and Total Quantity).
2. **Insert Chart**:
   - In Google Sheets, go to **Insert > Chart**.
   - In Microsoft Excel, go to **Insert > Charts**.
3. **Choose Chart Type**:
   - **Pie Chart**: Great for displaying the proportion of different resources used (e.g., Paper, Plastic, Water).
   - **Bar Chart**: Ideal for comparing the total CO2 savings across different resources.
4. **Customize the Chart**:
   - Add titles, labels, and legends to make the chart easy to understand.
   - Adjust colors to highlight the most important data.
5. **Interpretation**: Use these visualizations to track trends over time and identify areas where improvements can be made to reduce resource usage and CO2 emissions.
