# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## 1. What is the purpose of the Sustainability Tracker?
The Sustainability Tracker is designed to help you track resource usage (such as Paper, Plastic, Water, and Electricity) and calculate the CO2 savings associated with your efforts to reduce environmental impact.

## 2. How do I add new categories?
To add new categories, you can modify the dropdown list in the "Category" column by going to **Data > Data Validation** in Google Sheets or **Data > Validation** in Excel. Then, simply add your new category in the "List of Items" field.

## 3. What units can I use?
The tracker is set up to work with units such as:
- **kg** (kilograms) for Paper and Plastic
- **liters** for Water
- **kWh** (kilowatt-hours) for Electricity

You can modify the tracker to include other units if needed.

## 4. How does the CO2 impact calculation work?
The CO2 savings are calculated using predefined conversion factors. For example:
- Paper: 0.0015 tons of CO2 saved per kg
- Plastic: 0.002 tons of CO2 saved per kg
- Water: 0.003 tons of CO2 saved per liter
- Electricity: 0.5 tons of CO2 saved per kWh

These factors are used to estimate the CO2 saved based on the quantity of each resource.

## 5. How can I contribute to this project?
